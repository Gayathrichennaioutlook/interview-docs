## Code Injection


### Code Injections

Code injection is a prevalent form of attack where an adversary can execute malicious code in a system by taking advantage of the insecure coding practices followed by developers. In Java, this vulnerability primarily manifests when user inputs are not properly sanitized or validated before being used in the program. This allows an attacker to manipulate the code behavior to their advantage.

### Understanding Code Injection

When a program accepts input from an external source (e.g., user input, file, network), and this input is not properly validated, it could contain malicious code or commands. If this input is then used within the program in a way that gets executed, it can lead to code injection.

A simple illustration in Java could be using user input in a script execution scenario without proper validation. In such a case, an attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed as part of the application, leading to potentially severe security breaches.

### Example:

Consider the following simplistic Java example that accepts user input and executes it as a script:


```java
import javax.script.*;

public class CodeInjectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("JavaScript");
        String userInput = args[0];
        engine.eval(userInput);  // Unsafe
    }
}
```

In the code above, we are using the `javax.script` package to create a `ScriptEngineManager` and then a `ScriptEngine` for JavaScript. We then accept user input from the command line arguments and pass it directly to the `engine.eval()` method, which executes the input as a script. If an attacker provides malicious JavaScript code as input, it would be executed, leading to a code injection vulnerability.

### Mitigating Code Injection

Preventing code injection involves a multi-step approach that includes input validation, the use of safe APIs, and adhering to the principle of least privilege.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization:
Ensure that all input is validated and sanitized before it's used in your code. Validation means checking that the input meets certain criteria (e.g., a date is in the correct format), while sanitization involves cleaning or transforming the input to remove any potentially harmful content.

#### Use Safe APIs:
Whenever possible, use safe APIs that either do not allow for code execution or provide built-in protections against injection attacks.

#### Principle of Least Privilege:
Run your code with the least amount of privilege necessary to perform its tasks. This way, even if an attacker manages to inject code, the damage they can do is limited.

#### Parameterized Statements:
For database access, use parameterized statements or prepared statements, which ensure that user input is always treated as data and not executable code.

#### Escape Special Characters:
Ensure that special characters in user input that could be used to facilitate code injection are escaped.

#### Security Headers and Policies:
Implement security headers and policies like Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of code injection.

#### Regular Code Reviews and Security Testing:
Regular code reviews and security testing can help identify and fix code injection vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

By following these best practices and being mindful of the potential risks associated with user input, developers can significantly mitigate the risk of code injection vulnerabilities in their Java applications.

## Command Injections

Command injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system. This can potentially lead to full system compromise depending on the level of privileges the application has. In Java, command injection vulnerabilities often arise when the application executes system commands with unsanitized user input.

### Understanding Command Injections

The crux of command injection lies in the insecure handling of user input, especially when constructing system commands. If an application takes user input and includes it in a system command without properly validating or sanitizing the input, it opens up a door for attackers to manipulate the command, injecting malicious instructions.

#### Example:

Consider this simplistic Java example that takes user input to construct a system command for pinging an IP address:

```java
public class CommandInjectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String userInput = args[0];
        try {
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ping " + userInput);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `Runtime.exec` method is used to execute a system command. The command is intended to ping an IP address, with the address being supplied by the user. However, if the user provides input like `8.8.8.8; rm -rf /`, it would result in executing a destructive command (`rm -rf /`) on the system after the ping command.

### Mitigating Command Injection

Preventing command injection entails adhering to secure coding practices, validating user inputs rigorously, and minimizing the use of system commands within the application.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization:
- Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
- Sanitize user input by removing or escaping special characters that could be used to manipulate system commands.

#### Avoid System Commands:
- Minimize the use of system commands within your application.
- If possible, replace system command functionality with native Java code or safe libraries that provide the needed functionality.

#### Use Safe APIs:
- Utilize safe APIs that provide the needed functionality without resorting to system commands.

#### Whitelisting:
- If system commands are unavoidable, use a whitelist of allowed commands and strictly control the construction of the command string.
- Ensure only allowed commands and parameters can be executed.

#### Least Privilege Principle:
- Run your application with the least amount of privilege necessary to perform its tasks, reducing the potential damage in case of a command injection attack.

#### Logging and Monitoring:
- Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to command injection attempts.

#### Education and Code Reviews:
- Educate developers about the risks associated with command injection and how to prevent them.
- Perform regular code reviews and security testing to identify and fix potential command injection vulnerabilities.

By adhering to these best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of command injection vulnerabilities in their Java applications, creating a more secure and robust application environment.

Command injection is a severe security risk, and understanding how it works and how to prevent it is crucial for developing secure Java applications. This document has provided a foundational understanding of command injection, an illustrative example, and various preventative measures to mitigate this type of vulnerability.

## Connection String Injection

Connection String Injection is a type of vulnerability that arises when an application constructs database connection strings using unsanitized user input. This can allow an attacker to modify the connection string and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, leading to data theft, data loss, or unauthorized control over the database.

### Understanding Connection String Injection

A connection string contains information about how to connect to a database, including the database server's location, database name, and credentials. When constructing this string, if user input is used without proper validation or sanitization, it could lead to a Connection String Injection vulnerability.

#### Example:

Consider the following simplistic Java example that constructs a connection string using user input:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;

public class ConnectionStringInjectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String userInput = args[0];  // Assume user input is 'localhost;user=root;password=secret'
        String connectionString = "jdbc:mysql://" + userInput;
        try {
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionString);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the user input is directly appended to the connection string. If the user provides input such as `localhost;user=root;password=secret`, it could overwrite the username and password for the database connection, potentially granting unauthorized access to the database.

### Mitigating Connection String Injection

Preventing connection string injection requires careful handling of user input and other measures to ensure the security of database connections.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization:
- Rigorously validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
- Sanitize user input by removing or escaping special characters.

#### Use Prepared Statements:
- Utilize prepared statements for database access, which ensure that user input is always treated as data and not executable code.

#### Avoid Constructing Connection Strings:
- Avoid constructing connection strings with user input whenever possible.
- If user input must be used, ensure it's strictly validated against a whitelist of allowed values.

#### Least Privilege Principle:
- Ensure that database accounts used by your application have the least amount of privilege necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the potential damage in case of a connection string injection attack.

#### Encrypted Connections:
- Use encrypted connections to your database to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks that could reveal or modify connection strings.

#### Secure Configuration:
- Ensure your database and application are securely configured to minimize the risk of connection string injection and other vulnerabilities.

#### Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:
- Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix potential connection string injection vulnerabilities.

#### Education:
- Educate developers about the risks associated with connection string injection and how to prevent them.

By following these best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of connection string injection vulnerabilities in their Java applications, contributing to a more secure and robust application environment.

Connection string injection is a serious security risk that can have severe consequences if not adequately mitigated. Understanding the risks, knowing how to prevent them, and implementing secure coding practices are crucial steps in developing secure Java applications.

## LDAP Injection


LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) Injection is a type of attack in which the attacker exploits poorly sanitized input fields used within the application to construct LDAP statements. This vulnerability can lead to a variety of problems including bypassing login fields, divulging sensitive information, or in some cases even modifying or destroying information within the LDAP tree.

### Understanding LDAP Injection

LDAP is a protocol used to access and manage directory information services over a network. It is used in various services like email systems, centralized authentication servers, and more. An LDAP Injection attack can occur when user input is not properly sanitized and is used to construct and execute LDAP queries directly.

#### Example:

Consider the following simplistic Java example that constructs an LDAP query using user input:

```java
import javax.naming.*;
import javax.naming.directory.*;

public class LDAPInjectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String userInput = args[0];  // Assume user input is 'username*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*'
        String filter = "(uid=" + userInput + ")";
        try {
            DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext();
            NamingEnumeration<?> enumeration = ctx.search("ou=people,dc=example,dc=com", filter, null);
            while (enumeration.hasMore()) {
                SearchResult result = (SearchResult) enumeration.next();
                System.out.println(result.getName());
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, if the user provides input like `username*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*`, the resulting filter will be `(uid=username*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*)`, which is a malformed LDAP filter. This can potentially return all user entries in the directory, exposing sensitive information.

### Mitigating LDAP Injection

Preventing LDAP injection requires a combination of input validation, the use of safe APIs, and a secure configuration.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization:
- Validate input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
- Sanitize input by escaping special characters that are significant in LDAP queries.

#### Use Prepared Statements:
- Utilize prepared statements or parameterized methods to ensure user input does not interfere with the structure of the LDAP query.

#### Avoid Directly Using User Input:
- Avoid constructing LDAP queries directly with user input whenever possible.

#### Least Privilege Principle:
- Ensure that LDAP accounts used by your application have the least amount of privilege necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the potential damage in case of an LDAP injection attack.

#### Secure Configuration:
- Configure your LDAP server securely to minimize the risk of LDAP injection and other vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper error handling to prevent the leakage of sensitive information.

#### Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:
- Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix potential LDAP injection vulnerabilities.

#### Education:
- Educate developers about the risks associated with LDAP injection and how to prevent them.

By adhering to these best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of LDAP injection vulnerabilities in their Java applications, contributing to a more secure and reliable application environment.

LDAP injection is a severe security risk, and understanding how it works and how to prevent it is crucial for developing secure Java applications. This document provides a foundational understanding of LDAP injection, an illustrative example, and various preventative measures to mitigate this type of vulnerability.

## Injection Flaws 
Injection flaws, particularly SQL injection, are common in Java EE applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data tricks the interpreter into  executing unintended commands or changing data.


**Primary Defenses:**
Option 1: Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries)
Option 2: Use of Stored Procedures
Option 3: Allow-list Input Validation
Option 4: Escaping All User Supplied Input


**Additional Defenses:**
Also: Enforcing Least Privilege
Also: Performing Allow-list Input Validation as a Secondary Defense

## Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

Types of XSS attacks

There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are:

**Reflected XSS** :  where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
**Stored XSS** :  where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
**DOM-based XSS** : where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.


---

## How does XSS work?

Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.
