## Code Injection


### Code Injections

Code injection is a prevalent form of attack where an adversary can execute malicious code in a system by taking advantage of the insecure coding practices followed by developers. In Java, this vulnerability primarily manifests when user inputs are not properly sanitized or validated before being used in the program. This allows an attacker to manipulate the code behavior to their advantage.

### Understanding Code Injection

When a program accepts input from an external source (e.g., user input, file, network), and this input is not properly validated, it could contain malicious code or commands. If this input is then used within the program in a way that gets executed, it can lead to code injection.

A simple illustration in Java could be using user input in a script execution scenario without proper validation. In such a case, an attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed as part of the application, leading to potentially severe security breaches.

### Example:

Consider the following simplistic Java example that accepts user input and executes it as a script:


```java
import javax.script.*;

public class CodeInjectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("JavaScript");
        String userInput = args[0];
        engine.eval(userInput);  // Unsafe
    }
}
```

In the code above, we are using the `javax.script` package to create a `ScriptEngineManager` and then a `ScriptEngine` for JavaScript. We then accept user input from the command line arguments and pass it directly to the `engine.eval()` method, which executes the input as a script. If an attacker provides malicious JavaScript code as input, it would be executed, leading to a code injection vulnerability.

### Mitigating Code Injection

Preventing code injection involves a multi-step approach that includes input validation, the use of safe APIs, and adhering to the principle of least privilege.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization:
Ensure that all input is validated and sanitized before it's used in your code. Validation means checking that the input meets certain criteria (e.g., a date is in the correct format), while sanitization involves cleaning or transforming the input to remove any potentially harmful content.

#### Use Safe APIs:
Whenever possible, use safe APIs that either do not allow for code execution or provide built-in protections against injection attacks.

#### Principle of Least Privilege:
Run your code with the least amount of privilege necessary to perform its tasks. This way, even if an attacker manages to inject code, the damage they can do is limited.

#### Parameterized Statements:
For database access, use parameterized statements or prepared statements, which ensure that user input is always treated as data and not executable code.

#### Escape Special Characters:
Ensure that special characters in user input that could be used to facilitate code injection are escaped.

#### Security Headers and Policies:
Implement security headers and policies like Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of code injection.

#### Regular Code Reviews and Security Testing:
Regular code reviews and security testing can help identify and fix code injection vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

By following these best practices and being mindful of the potential risks associated with user input, developers can significantly mitigate the risk of code injection vulnerabilities in their Java applications.

## Command Injections

Command injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system. This can potentially lead to full system compromise depending on the level of privileges the application has. In Java, command injection vulnerabilities often arise when the application executes system commands with unsanitized user input.

### Understanding Command Injections

The crux of command injection lies in the insecure handling of user input, especially when constructing system commands. If an application takes user input and includes it in a system command without properly validating or sanitizing the input, it opens up a door for attackers to manipulate the command, injecting malicious instructions.

#### Example:

Consider this simplistic Java example that takes user input to construct a system command for pinging an IP address:

```java
public class CommandInjectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String userInput = args[0];
        try {
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ping " + userInput);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `Runtime.exec` method is used to execute a system command. The command is intended to ping an IP address, with the address being supplied by the user. However, if the user provides input like `8.8.8.8; rm -rf /`, it would result in executing a destructive command (`rm -rf /`) on the system after the ping command.

### Mitigating Command Injection

Preventing command injection entails adhering to secure coding practices, validating user inputs rigorously, and minimizing the use of system commands within the application.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization:
- Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
- Sanitize user input by removing or escaping special characters that could be used to manipulate system commands.

#### Avoid System Commands:
- Minimize the use of system commands within your application.
- If possible, replace system command functionality with native Java code or safe libraries that provide the needed functionality.

#### Use Safe APIs:
- Utilize safe APIs that provide the needed functionality without resorting to system commands.

#### Whitelisting:
- If system commands are unavoidable, use a whitelist of allowed commands and strictly control the construction of the command string.
- Ensure only allowed commands and parameters can be executed.

#### Least Privilege Principle:
- Run your application with the least amount of privilege necessary to perform its tasks, reducing the potential damage in case of a command injection attack.

#### Logging and Monitoring:
- Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to command injection attempts.

#### Education and Code Reviews:
- Educate developers about the risks associated with command injection and how to prevent them.
- Perform regular code reviews and security testing to identify and fix potential command injection vulnerabilities.

By adhering to these best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of command injection vulnerabilities in their Java applications, creating a more secure and robust application environment.

Command injection is a severe security risk, and understanding how it works and how to prevent it is crucial for developing secure Java applications. This document has provided a foundational understanding of command injection, an illustrative example, and various preventative measures to mitigate this type of vulnerability.

## Injection Flaws 
Injection flaws, particularly SQL injection, are common in Java EE applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data tricks the interpreter into  executing unintended commands or changing data.


**Primary Defenses:**
Option 1: Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries)
Option 2: Use of Stored Procedures
Option 3: Allow-list Input Validation
Option 4: Escaping All User Supplied Input


**Additional Defenses:**
Also: Enforcing Least Privilege
Also: Performing Allow-list Input Validation as a Secondary Defense

## Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

Types of XSS attacks

There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are:

**Reflected XSS** :  where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
**Stored XSS** :  where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
**DOM-based XSS** : where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

## How does XSS work?

Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.
