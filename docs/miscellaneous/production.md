## Production support tools


Production support tools for microservices are used to monitor, troubleshoot, and maintain microservices-based applications in a production environment. Here are a few examples of production support tools for microservices:

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that can be used to deploy and manage microservices. It provides features such as automatic scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates, which can make it easier to maintain microservices in a production environment.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool that can be used to monitor the performance of microservices. It provides features such as time-series data collection, alerting, and visualizations that can help identify and troubleshoot performance issues.

### ELK Stack

ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. It is a collection of open-source tools that can be used to collect, store, and analyze log data from microservices. This can help identify issues and troubleshoot problems.

### Zipkin

Zipkin is an open-source distributed tracing system that can be used to trace requests and responses between microservices. It can help identify and troubleshoot issues with service-to-service communication.

### Istio

Istio is an open-source service mesh that can be used to manage service-to-service communication in a microservices environment. It provides features such as traffic management, service discovery, and security that can help maintain microservices in production.

### Chaos Engineering

Chaos engineering is a practice of intentionally introducing controlled failures and disruptions to a system to identify weaknesses and improve resilience. Tools like Gremlin, Netflix's Chaos Monkey are used to test and improve the system's ability to handle failures and errors.

### Microservices API Management

API management platforms like Apigee, Kong, Tyk, etc. can be used to handle the API calls, security, and rate-limiting.

### Monitoring and alerting tools

like Datadog, New Relic, and Grafana can be used to monitor the health and performance of microservices. These tools can provide real-time visibility into resource usage, response times, and errors, which can help identify and troubleshoot issues.

### Service meshes

such as Linkerd and Consul Connect can help with service discovery, traffic management, and security in a microservices environment. They provide features like load balancing, service-to-service authentication and authorization, and traffic routing.

### Distributed tracing tools

like Jaeger and OpenTracing can help to trace the flow of requests and responses between microservices. This can help identify and troubleshoot issues with service-to-service communication and provide insight into the overall performance of the system.

### Configuration management tools

like Consul, etcd, and ZooKeeper can be used to store and manage configuration data for microservices. This can help to ensure that microservices are running with the correct configuration in different environments.

### CI/CD tools

like Jenkins, CircleCI, and TravisCI can be used to automate the build, test, and deployment of microservices. This can help to ensure that microservices are deployed and running correctly in different environments.

### Incident Management and IT Service Management (ITSM) platforms

like PagerDuty, Jira Service Desk, and ServiceNow can be used to manage and track incidents, service requests, and changes related to microservices. These tools can help to ensure that incidents are handled in a timely and efficient manner and that changes to the microservices are properly tracked and managed.

### Backup and recovery tools

like Veeam, Commvault, and Veritas can be used to backup and recover microservices and their data. These tools can help ensure that microservices and their data are protected in case of a disaster or other unexpected event.

### A/B testing and canary release tools

like Spinnaker, Jenkins X and GitLab can be used to test new features and releases of microservices before they are rolled out to production. These tools can help to minimize the risk of introducing new features and releases and can help to ensure that new features and releases are working correctly before they are made available to users.


In conclusion, there are many production support tools available for microservices, and the best choice will depend on the specific requirements of the application and the environment it is running in. It's important to use a combination of different tools to provide a comprehensive production support solution for microservices.
