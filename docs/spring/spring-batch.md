##  Introduction to Spring Batch

Spring Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. It also provides more advanced technical services and features that will enable extremely high-volume and high performance batch jobs through optimization and partitioning techniques. Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.

###  Features
- Transaction management
- Chunk based processing
- Declarative I/O
- Start/Stop/Restart
- Retry/Skip
- Web based administration interface (Spring Cloud Data Flow)


###  spring batch components

Spring Batch is a framework for batch processing in the Spring framework. It provides reusable functions for processing large volumes of data in batch jobs. The main components of Spring Batch include:

1. Job: A job is a batch process that is made up of one or more steps.

2. Step: A step is a single unit of work that is executed as part of a job. It can be as simple as reading data from a file and writing it to a database, or as complex as performing multiple tasks in parallel.

3. ItemReader: An ItemReader reads data from a source and provides it to the ItemProcessor.

4. ItemProcessor: An ItemProcessor processes the data read by the ItemReader and returns the processed data.

5. ItemWriter: An ItemWriter writes the processed data to a destination.

6. JobRepository: A JobRepository is responsible for maintaining the state of a job and its steps.

7. JobLauncher: A JobLauncher is used to launch a job.

8. JobExplorer: A JobExplorer allows you to access information about past execution of a job.

9. JobRegistry: A JobRegistry is used to register jobs with the batch infrastructure.

10. JobParameters: JobParameters are used to pass data to a job at runtime.

These are the main components of Spring Batch, there are many other components that can be used to customize and extend the functionality of the framework.
