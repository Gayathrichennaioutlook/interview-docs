##  Introduction React

React is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. 
It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. 

React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

Features of React are:

 It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
 Supports **server-side rendering**.
 Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
 Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.
