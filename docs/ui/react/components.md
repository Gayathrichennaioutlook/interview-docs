## React Components


Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.

In React, a Stateful Component is a component that holds some state. A Stateless component, by contrast, has no state. Note that both types of components can use props.
