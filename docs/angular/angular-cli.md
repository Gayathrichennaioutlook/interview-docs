Angular is a JavaScript framework for building web applications and Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that helps to create, manage, and test Angular projects. Here are some commonly used Angular CLI commands:

###   `ng new [project-name]` : Creates a new Angular project with the given name.

```typescript
ng new my-project
```

###    `ng serve` : Runs the project locally in development mode and starts a development server. It also watches for file changes and automatically rebuilds the application.

```typescript
ng serve

```

###   `ng generate [schematic] [name]`: Generates new files and updates existing files based on a schematic. The schematic can be a component, service, module, etc.

```typescript

ng generate component my-component

```

###   `ng build` : Builds the project for production and creates a distribution version in the dist folder. It also minifies and optimizes the code for better performance.

```typescript
ng build --prod


```
