Amazon EC2 provides cloud hosted virtual machines, called "instances", to run applications.

##EC2 instance

An EC2 instance is nothing but a virtual server in Amazon Web services terminology. It stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. It is a web service where an AWS subscriber can request and provision a compute server in AWS cloud.

An on-demand EC2 instance is an offering from AWS where the subscriber/user can rent the virtual server per hour and use it to deploy his/her own applications.

The instance will be charged per hour with different rates based on the type of the instance chosen. AWS provides multiple instance types for the respective business needs of the user.

Thus, you can rent an instance based on your own CPU and memory requirements and use it as long as you want. You can terminate the instance when itâ€™s no more used and save on costs. This is the most striking advantage of an on-demand instance- you can drastically save on your CAPEX.
